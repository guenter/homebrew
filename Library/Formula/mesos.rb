    Couldn't locate JDK7, here is how to fix it:

      1. Download and install JDK7 from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html
      2. Verify that it has been installed by running #{java_home_cmd}
      3. Re-run brew install mesos

      Mesos doesn't install on clang or apple-gcc-4.2.
      The only compiler I had luck with was gcc-4.6.

      Make sure to do the following:
        1. brew install gcc46
        2. brew install mesos --cc=gcc-4.6
    EOS
  end
